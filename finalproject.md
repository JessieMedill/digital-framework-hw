U.S. Soybean Bets on Chinese Market

WASHINGTON-With record acreage planted, U.S. soybean growers hope to expand exports to China this year as Chinese demand continues to increase, but competition from Brazil and concerns about U.S. genetically modified crops may dampen Chinese enthusiasm for U.S. soybeans.

The U.S. Soybean Export Council says Chinese grain buyers agreed to purchase 12.53 million tonnes of $4.5 billion U.S. soybeans, the second largest U.S. soybean purchase agreement in Des Monines, after a delegation from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce visited Des Moines, Iowa, on July 13. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects farmers will sow 89.5 million acres of soybeans this year, up 7.2 % from the record 83.4 million acres in 2016. On average, 45 % of the soybean crop has been exported during the past 10 years, and the USDA estimates that will rise above 50% in 2017-18.

China has become the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soybeans exports last year, worth more than $14 billion, according to the American Soybean Association. USDA expects China’s soybeans imports overall to hit 87 million tonnes in the 12 months ending Sept.1., the equivalent of one-fourth of the world crop.

Jerry Shi, deputy head of U.S. Grains at COFCO Americas Resources Corp., China’s state-owned grain trading company, said China’s increasing demand for soybeans is driven by the country’s livestock industry, which feeds its animals soybean meal. “As we are promoting urbanization, we have people moving from the countryside to the city, so we expect a continued increase in meat, milk and eggs consumption,” said Shi.

However, growing Chinese demand does not guarantee a profit for U.S. farmers as large crops in Brazil also provide China with purchasing options. In the year to July, China has imported a total of 54.9 million tonnes of soybeans, up 16.8% from the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Customs of People’s Republic of China.

“Soybean farmers in Brazil were reluctant to sell inventory as they were waiting for a stronger demand from the Chinese market to fetch a higher price,” Monica Tu, an analyst from Shanghai-based consultants JC Intelligence Co., said. “But Brazil harvested in June, so it largely increased exports in May, posing a threat to American soybeans.”

Mark Albertson, director of strategic market development at the Illinois Soybean Association, said Brazil isn’t the only competition: The real competitors are countries that grow palms and canola, which can replace soybeans to produce oil and feed animal. He said the U.S. must continue to produce large crops and keep prices low in order to keep competitive.

Chinese consumers’ concerns about the health effects of genetically modified crops also pose a threat to U.S. exports.

“Everyone says soybean oil made of GMOs soybeans is not good for health,” said Ling Liu, a housewife in Chongqing, China. “It's like those hormones. I don't want my family to eat too much.”
Soybean oil sales account for approximately 36% of all cooking oil sales in China, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Most soybean oil is made using GMO soybeans that are imported from the U.S. and elsewhere, which are nearly all genetically modified.

A Nielsen survey last year found that about 70% of Chinese are cautious about at least one food ingredient, above the global average of 64%, with 57% mentioning GMOs as undesirable.

“There are a lot of countries that are very sensitive about genetically modified organisms and they don't like U.S. soybeans, so the lack of universal acceptance of genetically modified beans is a challenge to U.S. famers, especially to Illinois farmers because so many of our soybeans are exported,” said Peter Goldsmith, director of the food and agribusiness program at the University of Illinois.

Albertson said the U.S. could increase its competitive edge by investing in infrastructure.

“In Illinois, we move a lot of our soybeans on the river, but the locks and dams along the rivers are in need of repair and they are too small,” he said. “In order to get a barge pole through the locks, we have to separate it into two parts, and that takes a lot of time and it's very expensive.”

Goldsmith said the competition and market pressures shouldn’t cause too much worry for U.S. soybean growers, however.

“Without our soybeans, their hog market wouldn’t be able to survive,” Goldsmith said. “There are simply not enough soybeans in Brazil and South America to supply China.” 

Reflection:
I’m always interested in writing about China-US economic relation and in April, my classmates and I visited Illinois Soybean Association where we got a chance to talk with local officials and soybean farmers. They told me that Illinois soybean exports are largely dependent on China, so I thought it would be interesting to find some data and take a look at the soybean trade relation between the world two largest economies. Then I went to the website of U.S. Department of Agriculture and found U.S. soybean farmers would sow a record acres of soybeans this year and China has become the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soybeans exports last year. Besides, a delegation from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce just signed a big contract with Iowa soybean producers, which in my opinions, can be used as a news hook and make the story more newsworthy. It’s comparatively easy to find experts to talk with because I visited some of them in person, and they also recommended some websites for me to look for data. After talking with all my sources, I found there is no guarantee that U.S. could benefit from China’s soaring soybean demands given the competition from South American countries and the health concerns of Chinese consumers. Since the experts mentioned these problems, I only needed to find related data to support them, so I searched for related stories online and used some research reports they cited before.
