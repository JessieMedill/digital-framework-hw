Ro Khanna serves as the U.S. Representative for California’s 17th congressional district as a member of the Democratic party after defecting eight-term incumbent congressman Mike Honda in the general election held on November 8, 2016.

Khanna was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1976, after his parents emigrated to the United States from India. He has an engineer father and a school teacher mother. Khanna received a B.A. degree in economics from the University of Chicago and a law degree from the Yale Law School, where his concentration is intellectual property law.

Khanna was appointed by President Barack Obama as deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2009, and was later appointed to the White House Business Council. He left the Department of Commerce in August 2011 and joined a law firm in Silicon Valley shortly before he was appointed to the California Workforce Investment Board in 2012.

Khanna calls for a more progressive economic platform. He has written a book, Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing Is Still Key To America’s Future, encouraging to bring advanced manufacturing jobs across America, and he expressed support for a broad technology apprenticeship program. He co-sponsored a bipartisan companion bill to reform H1B abuse, and he is a supporter of a more non-interventionist foreign policy. 

Khanna is an original co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders’ bill to make college affordable to all and is the founder of the No PAC Caucus in Congress whose members refuse all contributions from political action committees. He officially joined the Justice Democrats in May. 

Khanna now supports a bill to provide “Medicare for All” in the House.
